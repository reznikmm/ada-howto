# Day 15

We will use a lot of space in the primary stack. Let's increase default stack size with next magic by specifying a linker option:


```Ada
%largs -Wl,--defsym=__stack_size=130000000
```




    Now -largs options are: -Wl,--defsym=__stack_size=130000000



Firstly, we need a standard package to write the result.


```Ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
```

Let's define a dedicated type to count turns of the game. With it compiler will have more ways to check errors in the program. A dedicated value will represents cases when a value was never seen before.


```Ada
type Turn is new Positive;
Never : constant Turn := Turn'Last;
```

The `Last_Seen` array will keep a turn number for each seen value.


```Ada
Target : constant := 30_000_000;

Last_Seen : array (0 .. Target) of Turn :=
  (16 => 1, 12 => 2, 1  => 3, 0  => 4, 15 => 5, 7  => 6,
   others => Never);

```

A dedicated `Current` variable keeps current value.


```Ada
Current : Natural := 11;
```

Now we are ready to play the game:


```Ada
for J in Turn'(8) .. Target loop
   declare
      Prev : constant Natural := Current;
   begin
      if Last_Seen (Prev) = Never then
         Current := 0;
      else
         Current := Positive (J - 1 - Last_Seen (Prev));
      end if;
      Last_Seen (Prev) := J - 1;
   end;
end loop;

Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Current'Image);
```
