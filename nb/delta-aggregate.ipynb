    "Sometimes you need to create a copy of an object with a few modifications. Before Ada 2022 it would involve a dummy object declaration or an aggregate with associations for each property. Without \"a declaration expression\", the dummy object approach doesn't work in contract aspects. A limited component won't work with dummy object approach either. While  re-listing properties in an aggregate could be too hard. \n",
