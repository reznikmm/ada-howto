    "ARG used `Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class` to write a string image there. I didn't like this approach, because it's too low-level, error prone and nonportable, so I wrote [a proposal](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada-spark-rfcs/pull/17). I proposed to add a new abstraction Output_Text_Stream, where you can write Wide_Wide_String to. No encodings games, not CR/LF handling, no ridiculous UTF8_Strings. I have no explanation why the proposal isn't good enough nor argument why it should be done in a different way. Instead [the Standard](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xaarm/html/AA-4-10.html) was [changed](http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ai12s/ai12-0340-1.txt?rev=1.3) by adding Root_Buffer_Type, where you can `Put` a `Wide_Wide_String` and `Get` a `String` with no idea how it will be converted.\n",
